## Hints:

- <strong>Encoding password:</strong> Implement what is required, nothing special to come up with.

- <strong>Watter supplies:</strong> Maintain a left bound and a right bound (index) and move each of them only forward.

- <strong>Non divisible subsets:</strong> If (k|a) and (k|b) then what happens with the sum of (a % k) and (b % k)?
